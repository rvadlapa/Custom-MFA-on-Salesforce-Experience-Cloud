The requirement was to see how we can implement custom MFA on Experience Cloud. 
There are 2 components in here:
- Component to Register the authenticator
- Another component to verify the code

This assumes that the user was already established and this is for 2nd factor via an Authenticator app.

Note:
This is not production ready code.
